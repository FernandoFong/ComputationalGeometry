# Computational Geometry

## My own implementation of classical computational geometry algorithms on diverse languages.

This repository contains fully functional code on different languages, implementing the classic and basic algorithms of computational geometry, depending on the algorithm, is the language chosen to write the code. I use different types of datastructures, such as; stacks, vectors, lists, self-balancing trees, and so on.

### Graham Scan.

Given a set of points (S) in a plane, find the convex hull of S, where the convex hull fulfills that for every two points in S, say P, Q then the line PQ is fully contained on the convex hull. Time complexity: O(n log n), where n = |S|.
