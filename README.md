# Computational Geometry

## My own implementation of classical computational geometry algorithms on diverse languages.

### Graham Scan.

Given a set of points (S) in a plane, find the convex hull of S, where the convex hull fulfills that for every two points in S, say P, Q then the line PQ is fully contained on the convex hull. Time complexity: O(n log n), where n = |S|.
